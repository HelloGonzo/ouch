                <h2>A Neighborhood Away</h2>
                <p>â€¦follows two close friends and lovers on the night before one of the girls, who is struggling with internalized homophobia and an inability to commit to a relationship with a girl, moves out of their shared apartment.
                <br><br>
                The film is intentionally ambiguous as it tackles the hardships of navigating relationships from both ends of a coming out timeline. This film seeks to show truth in the stolen glances and hidden moments of a woman loving woman relationship growing from a deep female friendship.
